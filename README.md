### about me

---

My name is Ulli and I'm a virologist who's always seeking to learn new things. I attended a three-month web development bootcamp at [neue fische](https://www.neuefische.de/) to broaden my horizon and nourish my passion for logical thinking and creativity.

### about flashcards extreme

---

I created flashcards extreme as my capstone project at _neue fische_ to help me learn languages more efficiently. Currently I am learning Slovenian, therefore the conjugation function and declension info is targeted at this language. But I'm sure it will be useful for other languages as well.
